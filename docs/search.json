    "text": "Introduction\nClimate prediction is crucial in helping us understand the world we live in, prepare for future weather and climate changes, and mitigate potential climate risks.\nFor decades, scientists have been using a traditional climate model that utilizes complex mathematical equations to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, and land. These models have been the foundation of our current weather forecasts and long-term climate projections.\nHowever, with the rise of machine learning (ML), new climate prediction models have been developed using machine learning algorithms.\nIn this post, we’ll explore the strengths, limitations, and real-world applications of both traditional methods and machine learning in climate prediction."

One of the most commonly used traditional prediction models is Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model. An NWP model is a mathematical model that divides the Earth’s surface into a 3D grid of cells. For each cell, the model will calculate how different variables such as temperature, humidity, and pressure will change over time using established complex algorithms. Taking into account the interaction between neighbouring cells, NWP models will be able to predict future climate changes."

Global Coverage:\nTraditional models are often capable of simulating large-scale climate systems, thus providing a comprehensive view of global climate dynamics.\n2. Well-Established Framework:\nSince traditional models are based on fundamental physics principles and mathematical equations, the results are highly interpretable and consistent. Built upon decades of scientific research, these models have been continuously improved, refined and validated with observed climate data. Many of these models are highly reliable and can produce fairly accurate predictions."

    "text": "Weaknesses of Traditional Methods\n1. Computationally Expensive:\nWhile traditional models are able to produce accurate and reliable predictions, running these models can also be computationally expensive. Solving the complex equations involved in traditional prediction models often requires significant computational time, power and memory.\nOne example would be models that utilize high-resolution remote sensing data. While these models can capture finer details and interactions, they require much more memory, computation time and power to store and handle the extra information.\n2. Simplified Assumptions:\nDespite being grounded in physics, many of the models have to simplify certain physical processes due to the processes being too complex for actual computations. For example, cloud formation is highly dynamic, and explicitly modelling cloud formation may not be computationally feasible or efficient. Therefore, it is often parameterized instead of direct simulation, leading to potential inaccuracies.\n3. Limited Flexibility:\nClimate systems are dynamic in nature and are influenced by a wide range of factors. Therefore, traditional models require a lot of recalibration when dealing with some new or unexplored climate conditions, making them less adaptable."

ML algorithms, particularly those that are based on deep learning, can analyze huge amounts of data to identify patterns and relationships that are difficult for traditional models to capture. For example, extreme weather events like hurricanes and heat waves.\n2. Flexibility and Scalability:\nML models are much more flexible compared to traditional prediction models. While traditional models are often bound by their predefined systems of equations and computational limitations, ML models on the other hand are able to adapt to new data and scale to handle larger datasets. This makes them ideal for localized weather predictions or monitoring environmental changes.\n3. Real-Time Predictions:\nML models can process real-time data much more efficiently when compared to traditional models, allowing them to make faster real-time predictions, especially for time-sensitive events like hurricanes or heatwaves."

    "section": "Weaknesses of Machine Learning Models",
    "text": "Weaknesses of Machine Learning Models\n1. Lack of Physical Interpretation:\nUnlike traditional models where predictions can be explained by physical principles and equations, ML models are often considered “black boxes” because they make predictions based on input data and do not provide clear explanations of the process leading to their predictions. This lack of transparency can make it challenging to validate or interpret the results.\n2. Dependence on Quality Data:\nML model predictions, being mostly data-driven, are heavily relied on data quality. Inaccurate, biased, or incomplete datasets can lead to unreliable predictions. This is a particular concern in climate prediction, as climate and weather data can often be sparse or noisy.\n3. Risk of Overfitting:\nML models often run into the risk of overfitting to historical data, meaning they learn patterns, including noise and irrelevant details, from training data so well that they perform poorly on new, unseen data. This is particularly problematic in climate modelling because future climate conditions can deviate from past patterns as our environment changes. While deep learning ML models can discover hidden patterns in data, they may not always be able to capture the causal relationships between environmental variables that traditional models can describe."

Traditional Methods in Action\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Coupled Model Intercomparison Projet (CMIP6) FrameWork\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most influential examples of traditional climate modelling is the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP).\nCMIP is a collection of models that simulate various climate systems on Earth, providing projections for future temperature rises, sea-level changes, and regional precipitation patterns. For example, CMIP5 models are used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report to predict temperature changes under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. These models also played an important role in guiding international climate agreements, such as the Paris Agreement. \n\n\n2.
