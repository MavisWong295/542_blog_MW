    "text": "Introduction\nClimate prediction plays a crucial role in understanding global changes, forecasting extreme weather, and preparing for environmental challenges.\nFor decades, scientists have relied on traditional climate models—complex systems of equations simulating the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, and land. These models have been the foundation of weather forecasts and long-term climate projections.\nHowever, with the rise of machine learning (ML), a new era of climate prediction is emerging—one that promises adaptability, scalability, and often, enhanced predictive accuracy.\nIn this post, we’ll explore the strengths, limitations, and real-world applications of both traditional methods and machine learning in climate prediction."

High-resolution models, such as those used in remote sensing, capture fine details but demand more computational power.\n2. Simplified Assumptions:\nDue to computational limitations, NWP models often simplify complex physical processes, leading to inaccuracies, for example cloud formation is often parameterized rather than explicitly modeled.\n3. Limited Flexibility:\nClimate systems are highly dynamic and influenced by a multitude of factors. Traditional models need frequent recalibration when dealing with new or unexplored climate conditions, making them less adaptable."

    "text": "Weaknesses of Machine Learning Models\n1. Lack of Physical Interpretation:\nML models are often considered “black boxes” because they don’t provide clear explanations for their predictions. This lack of transparency can make it challenging to validate or interprete the results.\n2. Dependence on Quality Data:\nML models heavily rely on data quality. Inaccurate, biased, or incomplete datasets can lead to unreliable predictions, which is a concern in climate prediction, where data may be sparse or noisy.\n3. Risk of Overfitting:\nML models can overfit to historical data, making them less able to generalize to new, unseen scenarios. This is particularly problematic in climate modeling, where future conditions might differ from past patterns due to changing environmental factors. While deep learning can discover patterns in data, it may not always capture the causal relationships that traditional models can simulate."
